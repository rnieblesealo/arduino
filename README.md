# Arduino Notes

### Physics 2 Review

- Transducer = Converts x type of energy into electrical and vice-versa
    - Sensor = Converts x type of energy into electrical only
    - Actuator = Converts electrical energy into x type of energy
- Electricity goes from high to low potential
    - Ground = Point in circuit with least potential
- DC circuit = Electricity flows in 1 direction
- AC circuit = Electricity changes its direction very fast; this type comes from wall socket
- Current = Amount of electrical charge passing point per unit of time
- Voltage = Difference in energy between a point in a circuit and another
- Resistance = How much a component resists flow of electrical energy
- Polarized Component = Electricity flows in 1 direction 

### My Questions

- How can there be points in the board which we can deem ground? How can we control that?
