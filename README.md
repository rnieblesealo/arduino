# Arduino Notes

### Physics/Electrical Stuff 

- Transducer = Converts x type of energy into electrical and vice-versa
    - Sensor = Converts x type of energy into electrical only
    - Actuator = Converts electrical energy into x type of energy
- Electricity goes from high to low potential
    - Ground = Point in circuit with least potential
- DC circuit = Electricity flows in 1 direction
- AC circuit = Electricity changes its direction very fast; this type comes from wall socket
- Current = Amount of electrical charge passing point per unit of time
- Voltage = Difference in energy between a point in a circuit and another
- Resistance = How much a component resists flow of electrical energy
- Polarized Component = Electricity flows in 1 direction 

### Components

LED
- Long leg (anode) = connects to power
- Short leg (cathode) = connects to ground

Resistor
- Sucks up and converts some electricity to heat
> Allows us to control electricity going in so components don't get too much 

Switch
- Allows us to break the circuit

# My Questions

- How can there be points in the board which we can deem ground? How can we control that?

# Other Notes

### Bash Scripting

- `zsh` and `bash` differ a bit in syntax; make sure we always use bash by shebanging `#!/bin/bash`
